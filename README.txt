Based on data, Bellabeat can have a major leap in the health monitoring industry by innovating in smart-device tracking, taking advantage of trends, and exploiting potential opportunities with users and technology alike. In this report, data was extracted from a FitBit user log spanning two months of recordings from over 30 users across different categories. From there, in RStudio, data cleaning was carried out across multiple data frames, analysis conducted, and visualizations drawn, all so that Bellabeat could have solidly-based recommendations as to what to do in order to accomplish its business task.
