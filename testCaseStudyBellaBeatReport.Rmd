# Business Task Summary
Bellabeat is a small but successful high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products, particularly towards women. With Points of Sale (POS) both in e-commerce and physical retailing, paired with the growing market trend towards smart health monitoring, the company’s leadership believes new growth opportunities for Bellabeat can be achieved by better understanding market data and taking data-driven decisions. 
By identifying trends in smart device usage, and extrapolating towards Bellabeat’s own customers, the company could modify their product development and marketing strategies to better appeal and solve their customers’ needs. As such, Bellabeat would gain a competitive advantage by keeping up with what is demanded with what and how they innovate in turn. Fitness trackers and smartwatches now include features like heart rate monitoring, sleep tracking, ECG capabilities, blood oxygenation, and tests are research is being conducted to also include blood sugar measurements. The following general statistics help give a big picture regarding the positive environment in which Bellabeat could potentially thrive: 
* The global wearable technology market in health and fitness was projected to reach $60 billion USD by 2023 (Psico-Smart Editorial Team. 2024)
